Basics of Probability

Perspectives on Probability
    - probability -> way of quantifying the likelihood of a future outcome
    - two broad schools of thought
        1. frequentist school
            -> defines probability as describing how often outcome A would occur in an experiment if that experiment were repeated over and over
                -> tossing a coin and landing on heads has a 50% outcome over many coin flips

        2. Bayesian school
            -> defines probability as describing how likely an observer expects outcome A to be in the future, based on previous experience and expert knowledge
                -> each time experiment is run and new data is added, the belief about the outcome is changed
                -> prior probability -> based on previous experiences
                -> posterior probability -> updated probability based on latest experiment

    - frequentists are trying to calculate the likelihood of getting the data you have in the context of a fixed, if unknown, 'true', population value
    - bayesians are trying to calculate the most likely population value, given the data you have
        -> as the data changes, Bayesians beliefs about the population value change as well
