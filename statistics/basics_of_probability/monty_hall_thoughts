If I choose a door and the host reveals one of the other two doors is a dud, does it matter if I actually change?
When initially picking a door you have a 1 in 3 chance of getting a prize.
Meaning there is a 2 in 3 chance that you are wrong.
If the host reveals that one of the other two doors is a dud, it ceases to be a 2/3 chance and becomes a 1/2 chance at getting a prize.
Therefore, I don't think it actually matters.
The Bayes Theorem is probably connected because the opening of another door changes the probability conditionally.
If another door is opened, and the first door you picked is still at a 1/3 chance, the extra 2/3 is shifted to the remaining door, thus you should switch.
