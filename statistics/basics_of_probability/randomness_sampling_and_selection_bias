Randomness, Sampling and Selection Bias

- quantify uncertainty
    -> 'maybe it will rain' to '65% chance'
    -> not only defines what is known, but how confident we can be about that knowledge

- probability is the basis of Randomness
    -> Randomness -> a situation where all possible outcomes are equally likely

- data scientists leverage the concept of randomness to gather a representative sample from the population
    -> using randomness, each element of a population has an equal chance of being chosen for the sample

Larger samples are more likely to resemble the population
    -> less likely to be swayed by occasional extreme values

Smaller samples are cheaper and faster to collect

The more variability in the population, the larger sample we need to get to be confident that our sample is a good stand-in for the population

-> however, samples are random, so through luck the sample may be a poor representation

Selection bias
    -> systematic difference between the sample and the population
    -> if sample individuals differ from the others in important ways
        -> spending rates, purchasing behavior
        -> knowledge gained, will not necessarily apply to all customers

Better to have a small but representative sample than a large, biased one
