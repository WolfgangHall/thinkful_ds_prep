Bayes' Rule


Conditional Probability
    - Say you have x disease that infects 1 in 1,000,000
    - test says it's 99.99% accurate
    - 100 people are expected to get positive results
    - only 1 person out 101 actually has the infection
        - 1% chance you are infected

    - Bayes' rules gives this relationship in terms of probabilities


Bayes' Rule

    P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

    The probability of A given B equals the probability of B given A
        -> times the probability of A
            -> divided by the probability of B

    or

    P(A | B) = P(B| A) * P(A)  /  [P(A) * P(B | A) + P(A~) * P(B | A~)]

    expansion of probability of B
        A~ is the inverse of A (not being infected)

    numerator is scenario of interest
    denominator represents the realm of scenarios that could give our condition



    P(Infected | Positive Test) = P(Positive Test | Infected) * P(Infected) / P(Positive Test)

    the probability of being infected given a positive test equals
        -> the probability of having a positive test given Infection
            -> times the probability of infection
                -> divided by the probability of a positive test
