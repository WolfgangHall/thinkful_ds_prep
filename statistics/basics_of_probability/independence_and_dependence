Independence and Dependence

- when talking about probabilities, always consider whether the events are independent or dependent of one another

independent
    -> an event is independent of other events in the sample if the outcome of that event is not affected by the outcome of other events in the sample space
        -> picking a marble out of 10 AND putting it back
            -> because marble is put back, drawing probabilities are still the same

    -> probability of two or more independent events can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event

    10 marbles => 5 red, 5 blue
    1/2 chance of red
    1/2 chance of blue
    Chance of drawing a red marble then a blue marble:
        1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4


dependent
    -> when the probability of event B changes based on the outcome of Event A
        -> event B is dependent or conditional on event A
    -> use a | (pipe) to denote conditionals

    10 marbles => 5 red, 5 blue
    5/10 chance of red
    5/9 chance of blue

    The probability of red given blue
    P(red | blue) = 5/9

    if first marble was blue, probability of drawing a blue marble again is 4/9
    P(blue | blue) = 4/9
    probability of drawing blue again is conditional on drawing blue the first time

    probability of two conditional events
        -> calculated by multiplying the probability of event A by the probability of event B conditioned on  A
    P(A n B) = P(A) * P(B | A)

    probability of drawing two blues
    P(blue n blue) = P(blue) * P(blue |blue)
             = 5/10 * 4/9
             = 2/9

    probability of drawing red then blue
    P(red n blue) = P(red) * P(red | blue)
                  = 5/10  * 5/9
                  = 5/18

    in data, conditional variables contribute less data than independent variables
        -> some information is duplicated among conditional variables

        if we can find the answer to another set of data based on another piece of data
            -> did you buy any widgets?
                - if the answer is no then we already know they spent 0 dollars on widgets
            -> how much did you spend on widgets?
                -> if the answer is 0, then we already know they did not buy widgets
