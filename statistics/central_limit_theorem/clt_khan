The p-value is the chance that the results you are looking at happened by random chance and not as a result of whatever you are testing.


histogram -> probability density


compare dataset to standard distribution

t-value tries to measure data and normal distributions distance
    -> doesn't tell you anything unless statistically significant
        -> p-value checks for significance

        if p-value is above a certain threshold, you can accept it or not

        check to see if two data samples are not from the same population

        whatever you try to prove, test the p-value
        you always try to reject the alternate hypothesis



t-values quantify how close samples are



p-value



standard -> relaxed .05
         -> standard .01


t-value quantifies
p-value makes the decision



redo drill on  descriptive statistics
