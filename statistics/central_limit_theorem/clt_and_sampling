The central limit theorem shows that normal distributions can still be used to analyze samples of data from non-normally distributed populations

when sampling from a population
    -> as the sample size gets larger
        -> the sample means tend to follow a normal probability distribution
        -> clusters around the true population mean

    statistics can be calculated and population parameters can be estimated
        -> even when the distribution is unknown


statistics are used to discover info about populations
    -> need to be comfortable calculating statistics when we know little about a population

the CLT unlocks the door to the statistic (central tendency and variance) that we have learned about
