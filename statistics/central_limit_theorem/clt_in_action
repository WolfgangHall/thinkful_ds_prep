- compare the means of two samples, taken from two populations
    - calculate the means and the standard deviations of each sample
    - subtract one mean from the other

        - look at the size of the difference
            - in the context of the combined variance of the two samples

        - the larger the difference is relative to the variance
            -> the less likely the difference is to be due to random chance
            -> the more likely it is to reflect meaningful differences between the two populations

- to combine variances
    -> the squared standard deviations are divided by the sample size
        -> and summed
            -> take square root of the sum
- this is the standard error of the difference
    -> represents the variance in the sample differences around the population


- the difference divided by the standard error is a ration
    -> called the t-value
- T-values put the difference in context
    -> tell us how large the difference is relative to the amount of variance in data
        -> amount of variance is called noise

- Given a t-value we can calculate the probability that a t-value at least this extreme would occur by chance
    -> called a p-value
- tells us how likely it is that we would get the sampling data we observe if the two population means were not different

- p-value runs between 0 and 1
    -> 0 -> it is impossible to get a difference of this size or greater in the absence of a real population difference
    -> 1 -> we will Always get a difference of this size or greater in the absence of a real population difference

    -> the lower the p-value, the more confidently you can conclude that there is a meaningful difference between the means of the two groups of population


- The t-value scales the difference between the two groups by the amount of variance in the two samples.


-  High variability in samples can lead to groups with means that look very different,
    - but when we look at the histogram we see that most of the values in the sample groups overlap.

- interpret a t-value as the number of standard errors worth of space separating the group means 
    - A t-value of 2 would indicate that the means are two standard errors apart

- p-value is likelihood of getting a difference this large or larger in the samples if the populations were not different
    - the smaller the p-value, the more likely the difference we see in the samples meaningfully reflects the population

    - if p-value is small, you can be fairly confident that the difference in means is due to a real difference in population, and not due to variability in the samples
