Define Normality

- data is described as 'normal' or 'normally distributed'
    - if most values cluster in the center of the range
    - rest tapers of symmetrically to the left and the right

    - the mean and the median of a normally distributed variable are equal

    Euler's Number
        -> e = 2.71828

    - approximately 68% of values in a normally-distributed variable fall within 1 standard deviation above or below the mean
    - 95% fall within two standard deviations
    - 99.7% fall within three standard deviations

Normal distribution is useful because:

        -> easily summarized using two statistics
        -> area under curve is 1, makes it easy to calculate probabilities
        -> describes natural phenomena -> blood pressure, height, weight
        -> commons scores (percentiles, z-scores) and statistical tests assume normal dists
