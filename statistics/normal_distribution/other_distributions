Many other probability distributions

Bernoulli
    -> represents two possible outcomes of an event
    -> summarized by p
        -> the probability of the outcome k

        -> when a distribution is discrete(only takes integers)
            -> probability mass function
        -> when a distribution is continuous
            -> probability density function



Binomial
    -> binomial distribution counts the number of successes when an event with two possible outcomes is repeated many times (like many coin flips)
        -> summarized by p, the probability of getting k successes during n repetitions of the event

Gamma
    -> gamma distribution represents the time until an event, when the event starts out likely, then becomes more likely, then becomes more unlikely again
        -> lifespan until death
            -> not likely at young age
            -> more likely as time goes
            -> less likely as many do not make it to extreme old age

        probability density function:

Poisson
    -> poisson distribution represents the number of times a given event will occur during a given time interval, based on a count of the number of times an event occurs during a given time period
        -> lambda is the rate that events occur during a given time period

Conditional Distribution

    -> distributions can be conditional
