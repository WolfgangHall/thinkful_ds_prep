Deviations from normality and descriptive statistics

Real Data is never perfectly normal

when statistics assume normality and are used on non-normal data, inaccurate conclusions can be made

best method of deciding if data is normal is visual inspection
    -> histograms
    -> quantile-quantile (QQ) plots

QQ plots
    -> graph a variable with an unknown distribution against a variable with a known distribution

    -> values for each variable are sorted into ascending order, then plotted against each other
        -> known variable is x-axis
        -> unknown variable is y-axis

    -> if mystery data has same distribution as known variable
        -> result is a straight line from lower left to upper right
        -> deviations indicate a lack of distribution fit

** refer to deviations_from_normal_dists.ipynb

- with a QQ plot, the scales of the known and unknown variables do not have to match
- the relationship between data points matters

- when data are not normal, the mean and standard deviation are no longer accurate or informative summaries


Asymmetric probability distributions are described as 'skewed'
